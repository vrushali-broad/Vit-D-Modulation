### ðŸ§¬ Abstract

**Summary:**  
Circulating Vitamin D (Vit-D) has emerged as a potent immune modulator in asthma, yet its direct impact on T<sub>H</sub>2 cell regulationâ€”the central effectors of allergic inflammationâ€”remains unclear. Preliminary transcriptomic analysis of neonatal cord blood revealed that gestational Vit-D deficiency corresponds to elevated adaptive and innate immune responses, driven by T<sub>H</sub>2 immunity and antimicrobial responses related to asthma inflammation. To elucidate cell-specific molecular mechanisms of Vit-D, we differentiated murine T<sub>H</sub>2 cells *in vitro* under conditions mimicking Vit-D sufficiency and deficiency. Our findings demonstrate that Vit-D exposure promotes intracellular calcium ion homeostasis while suppressing prominent inflammatory cytokines characteristic of asthma. Conversely, Vit-D deficiency reprograms T<sub>H</sub>2 cell lineage commitment, inducing overexpression of cytolytic molecules and MHC class I moleculesâ€”traits typically associated with cytotoxicity rather than helper function. These findings underscore Vit-Dâ€™s role in stabilizing T<sub>H</sub>2 cell function and fate, offering insights into asthma and autoimmune disorders.
